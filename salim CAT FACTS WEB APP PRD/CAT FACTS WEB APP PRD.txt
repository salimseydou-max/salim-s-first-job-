7. UX & Design Requirements
Overall Experience
The Random Cat Fact Generator should feel simple, playful, and delightful. The interaction flow must be intuitive and clear: users should always understand what the app is doing, whether it is loading content, showing results, or encountering an error.
Responsive Layout
The webpage must be fully responsive and adjust gracefully to different screen sizes so students understand how web pages transform into web apps.
Requirements:
               * Use a flexible layout (CSS Grid or Flexbox) that adapts on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

               * All elements should remain centered and proportionally spaced on all screen sizes.

               * The “Get Cat Fact” button must remain fully visible and accessible at all viewport sizes.

               * Text containers should resize or wrap appropriately to maintain readability.

               * Padding and margins should adjust based on screen width to maintain good spacing.

               * The design should function cleanly inside a simulated mobile preview (e.g., browser dev tools).

Visual Hierarchy
                  * The fact display card should be the largest visual element on the page.

                  * The button should be distinct and visually inviting.

                  * Loading and error messages should appear in a subtle but clearly visible style beneath the button.

Color & Style Guidelines
                     * Use a playful pastel-themed color palette.

                     * Button should use a bright accent color to encourage interaction.

                     * Fact container should use a soft rounded card with a subtle drop shadow.

                     * Typography should be clean and readable, ideally a sans-serif font.

Interaction Feedback
                        * Button press should include a micro-interaction (hover or active state).

                        * Loading state should display immediately and be visually distinct from the cat fact.

                        * Error messages should be friendly and reassuring (e.g., “Oops! Couldn’t fetch a fact. Try again!”).

Accessibility
                           * Provide sufficient color contrast between text and background.

                           * Ensure interactive elements are large enough to tap on mobile screens.

                           * All text must be readable on small screens.

                           * Use semantic HTML for improved screen reader compatibility.
